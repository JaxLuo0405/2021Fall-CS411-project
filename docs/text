IDEA 2: City Playlist
This application allows users to select any city in the world. Based on their selection a Spotify playlist will be generated based on the weather in the
selected city that day. For example, if it is cloudy/rainy the generated playlist will include sad songs. In addition, the songs chosen for the playlist will be 
restricted to artists from the country the city is in. For the database requirement, we could store the selected city, weather in that city, 
and songs in the generated playlist. We could potentially utilize a weather API, Spotify API, and MusicBrainz API (lists artists and basic information such 
as where they are from).For the third-party authentication, we could have users sign into Spotify.
