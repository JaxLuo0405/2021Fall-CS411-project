Technology Stacks

For our web application, the technology stack will include Python, Django, HTML, and SQLite:

HTML is a standard language for creating web apps. 

SQLite works as a good database engine, considering this would be a low to medium traffic website. It’s also used as a cache of relevant content, which reduces latency.
	
We chose to use Python for backend as it has the most support across the APIs we want to use. Also, because we are all mostly familiar with the language and it allows us to use Django. 

We picked Django because it can work with any client-side framework and deliver content in several formats, like HTML. The Django model provides a simple query API for searching the associated database. Django also simplifies HTML Forms, which we can use to collect user date for processing. And it provides flexible caching so that we can store all or part of a rendered page so that it doesn’t get re-rendered. It is also a Python framework so using Python and Django go hand in hand. We considered using Node.js, but we are unable to use Node.js because it utilizes JavaScript and not Python.
